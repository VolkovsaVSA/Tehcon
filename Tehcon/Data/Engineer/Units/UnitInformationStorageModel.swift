The most common units are the bit and the byte (or octet). Information capacity is a dimensionless quantity because it refers to a count of binary symbols.\nA bit is the basic unit of information in computing and telecommunications; a bit can have the value of either 1 or 0 only. A bit can also be defined as a variable or computed quantity that can have only two possible values. These two values are often denoted by the numerical digits 0 and 1. These two values can also be interpreted as logical values (true/false, yes/no), on/off state or any other two-valued attribute or physical condition such as flow/no flow or high pressure/low pressure.\nA byte is a unit of digital information in computing and telecommunications that most commonly consists of eight bits.", comment: "unit type description")
